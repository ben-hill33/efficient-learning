## Efficient Learning

This course is from Zero to Mastery and focuses on how to be an efficient learner. I bought this course specifically on udemy to increase my learning curve to be able to handle getting through my coding bootcamp at Code Fellows to be a software developer.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ben-hill33/efficient-learning/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ben-hill33/efficient-learning/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
